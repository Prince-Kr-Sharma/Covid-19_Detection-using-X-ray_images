# Covid-19_Detection-using-X-ray_images

Detection of covid-19 using x-ray_images of Chest using Deep Learning.

It consist of samples an open source dataset of X-ray images for patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 and 
normal (i.e., not infected) X-ray images from healthy patient.
Training a CNN to automatically detect COVID-19 in X-ray images on these datasets by comapring the both Normal and Covid-19 X-ray images. 

Dependencies:-
1.Tensorflow
